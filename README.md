Gadgets of the Sky is a mod that adds various gadgets, useful for travel, combat and more. 
They are crafted using shards that can be created at a sky altar that spawns in a new structure.

## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to find a buried treasure chest. 
You can find maps to them in shipwrecks and underwater ruins.
The chest will contain, in addition to the normal contents, a sky island explorer map. 
Make sure to also pick up the heart of the sea, as you'll need it later.
This map will lead you to a sky island, where you can find a sky altar.

The sky altar will display what items it is able to accept. 
When you first arrive it will ask for the heart of the sea.
You can place it in the altar by right-clicking it with the item in your hand or by using a hopper or other automation mods.
The altar will consume the heart of the sea and flames will light up on the corners. 
This indicates that it is active and ready to accept more items.

Next it will ask you for glowstone dust. This is required to fuel the altar. 
One dust will power it for 3 uses. 
You can easily automate this by placing a hopper facing into the altar and filling it with glowstone dust.

Once the altar is active it will cycle between showing the items it accepts as input for crafting.
By default, it will accept a piece of nether quartz or a glow inc sac. 
The quartz will give you an air shard and the inc sac will give you a water shard.
You can view all recipes using EMI and custom recipes can be added with datapacks. 

With these shards you can craft various gadgets that will help you in your adventures.
You can view their recipes in the recipe book (they unlock after obtaining a shard) or using any recipe viewer.

## Features
### Sky Altar
The sky altar is a new crafting station that can be found on floating islands above many mountainous biomes.
It's used to craft shards that can be used to craft gadgets. 
The altar is powered by glowstone dust, which needs to be refilled every 3 uses.

If broken the altar will drop itself, any stored items, and the heard of the sea if it was active.
You do not need a tool to break the altar, but using a pickaxe will speed up the process.

Altars can be automated using hoppers and other automation mods. 
You can insert fuel and crafting ingredients to the altar and extract the outputs.
Automation is easy as altars only accept either fuel or crafting ingredients at a time,
and don't allow removing items unless they can't be used for crafting.

### Sky Island
Sky islands are a new structure that can be found above mountainous biomes.
They contain a sky altar. The easiest way to find one is to find a buried treasure chest and follow the map to the island.
Make sure to look up while searching for islands as they can spawn quite high up.

### Shards
Shards are a new item that can be crafted at the sky altar.
They don't do anything on their own and only act as crafting ingredients for gadgets.

### Water Orb
The water orb is a gadget that allows you to swim in the air. 
It's crafted using a diamond, two water shards and two nautilus shells.
It's activated by right-clicking it in your hand and the effect lasts for 10 seconds.

While active, you will be able to swim in the air and will not take fall damage.
After using it will be on cooldown for an additional 2 seconds before it can be used again.
Water orbs have 50 uses before they break.

Water orbs can be used for a variety of purposes:
- They can help with navigating difficult terrain and climbing steep hills.
- They can be used to escape from mobs or players.
- They can be used to get down from high places without taking fall damage.
- They can be used to get through small holes without using trapdoor or an elytra.

### Water Staff
The water staff is a gadget that allows you to shoot water projectiles.
The staff is crafted using a water shard, a stick and a diamond.
It can be used by right-clicking it in your hand.

It shoots a projectile that will place a temporary water block where it lands.
The projectile will travel for 2 seconds before disappearing,
and the staff has 128 uses before it breaks.
After using it will be on a short cooldown before it can be used again.

The water staff is primarily useful for negating fall damage and extinguishing fires,
but it could also be used to harvest crops or push mobs around.

### Air Staff
The air staff is a gadget that allows you to shoot wind charges like the breeze does.
The staff is crafted using an air shard, a stick and a diamond.
It can be used by right-clicking it in your hand and has 128 uses.

The projectile pushes players and mobs away from where it lands 
and can also trigger redstone components. 
It doesn't cause damage to mobs, but can be used to push them off of cliffs or into the air.

The air staff is really useful for movement as you can "rocket jump" using it with some practice.
It's also useful for triggering redstone components from a distance or breaking contraptions.
